# THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! PLEASE DO NOT USE ON ANYONES NETWORKS EXCEPT YOUR OWN WITHOUT PERMISSION! DO NOT BE A DOUCHE, DEAUTHING NETWORKS AGAIN AND AGAIN IS NOT COOL AND IS JUST INCREDIBLY ANNOYING
# pygeddon

A project to create a multi platform educational python script with features such as deauthing networks, recognising deauth frames and other network attacks/defences, similar to airgeddon for linux.

# Current Features

Can deauth single or multiple networks at once but still needs the channel to be manually selected using other software like aireplay-ng. Unless on OSX where channel can be specified when running the script. Also has a built in sniffer for finding target AP's or a manual option to input the AP's MAC address. (deauth.py)

Can detect deauth frames and display a basic overview of the deauth packet. (deauth-detect.py)
